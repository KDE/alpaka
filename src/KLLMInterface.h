/**
 * @brief The KLLMInterface class provides an interface around the LLM API.
 *
 * KLLM is designed to feel similar to Qt Network. This means that all LLM requests must be routed through a central
 * KLLMInterface object.
 *
 * To request a message or completion from the LLM, first create a KLLMRequest object with the desired message. Choose the
 * model from models() that you wish to use for this request and set it on the KLLMRequest. Then call getCompletion(),
 * passing your KLLMRequest object. You will recieve a KLLMReply object; connect to KLLMReply::contentAdded() if you wish to
 * receive content updates as they arrive from the server or connect to KLLMReply::finished() if you prefer to have the whole
 * message delivered at once.
 *
 * You should not request any completions (or otherwise use this class) until ready() returns true. Using the interface
 * before it is ready can cause problems; for example, the interface may not have loaded the available models yet or the
 * backend could be unreachable.
